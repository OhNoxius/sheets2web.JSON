Jarrett played a solo set before being followed by the Gary Burton Quintet. From the master cassettes. Recorded from about halfway back in the main center section of the auditorium, using an inexpensive Panasonic mono recorder with ALC and cheap Ampex tapes. The original tapes cannot be located. This digital transfer was made from those tapes early in the 21st century. At that time, EQ was used to remove the extreme bottom frequencies to eliminate rumble and the extreme high frequencies to reduce hiss.","CE_tracklist":null,"transmission:name":null,"transmission:series":null,"transmission:station":null,"transmission:date":null,"transmission:link":null},{"type":"audio","concert":"Keith

February 2012. 48 Live sessions on 36 torrents:\nSome of these tapes are not in good shape, but anyway, itâ€™s Warne Marsh!\nI used the wonderful book of Safford Chamberlain â€˜An Unsung Catâ€™, Scarecrow Press, 1985, for most informations.\nDonâ€™t miss the companion of this book : Storyville CD: STCD 8314 â€˜An Unsung Catâ€™, 2000.\nglockenspiel, February 2012.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAs indicated in the accompanying details, this is the full source for the bootleg Naked City CD: CD 007 â€” Warne Marsh Live In Las Vegas, 1962. The CD release was of a higher generation and contained numerous drop outs and other flaws including the omission of tracks 7,8,9,10 and 12 so this should be considered an upgrade. As with the CD, while not high on fidelity, this is quite a nice listen and a sonic improvement with an additional 50% worth of material. Subsequent to its initial circulation, various minor flaws have been repaired in this version. The music is high powered vintage Warne Marsh with an excellent band at an exceptionally rare timeframe in his career and one of the better sessions in the live sessions series.

The audio is still pretty rough sounding and I was tempted to try and EQ it a bit, but other than normalizing it, I decided just to leave it as is.

Some of these recordings have been around for years but none of the master tapes or safety copies in some cases have ever been digitized until now. Dave and Donn taped many shows in and around the Seattle area in the 70's and also were contemporaries of some of the JEMS members. Volume 21 captures jazz guitar great Larry Coryell with his Foreplay band from a KOL FM broadcast recorded by Dave's brother when it was broadcast originally. This is one blistering set of jazz fusion played with the furiosity of Mahavishnu Orchestra but with a looseness and swing of rock along the lines of Little Richard that was usually missing in most jazz fusion stews of this time.","CE_tracklist":null,"transmission:name":"D & D Archives Master Series Volume

Several months ago Lewerke, president of Vault Records, queried European TV sources about airing a series of shows depicting top American jazz artists working before club audiences. The response was so posiI tive, Lewerke says, that he hired a film crew and began setting up programs. Thus far he has four shows in the can and will be taking them with him to show European TV officials followingMIDEM. Each of the shows will havea separate script in English which will be translated into the language of the individual country airing the program. Jazz experts in each European countrybuying the film will be hired to act as announcers. Lewerke has named Si- mone Ginibre as sales agent for the series in Paris. Euro-Film Corp. is Lewerke’s new firm. “The idea behind the series is to show European viewers a typical jazz club and to catch the excitement of the jazz performer working before an appreciative audience,” Lewerke explains. Lewerke eventually hopes to get the series placed on American tele- vision through syndication.

Several months ago Lewerke, president of Vault Records, queried European TV sources about airing a series of shows depicting top American jazz artists working before club audiences. The response was so posiI tive, Lewerke says, that he hired a film crew and began setting up programs. Thus far he has four shows in the can and will be taking them with him to show European TV officials followingMIDEM. Each of the shows will havea separate script in English which will be translated into the language of the individual country airing the program. Jazz experts in each European countrybuying the film will be hired to act as announcers. Lewerke has named Si- mone Ginibre as sales agent for the series in Paris. Euro-Film Corp. is Lewerke’s new firm. “The idea behind the series is to show European viewers a typical jazz club and to catch the excitement of the jazz performer working before an appreciative audience,” Lewerke explains. Lewerke eventually hopes to get the series placed on American tele- vision through syndication. Among the artists filmed on location are pianist Les McCann and his trio","tenor saxophonist Zoot Sims and a Los Angeles rhythm section of drummer Larry Bunker, pianist Roger Kellaway and bassist Chuck Berghofer","blues singer Joe Turner","pianist Hampton Hawes, bassist Leroy Vinnegar, drum- mer Bobby Thompson, saxophonist Sonny Criss and trumpeter Harry “Sweets” Edison","drummer Shelly Manne, bassist Ray Brown and tenor saxophonist Bob Cooper.
