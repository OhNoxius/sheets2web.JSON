Jarrett played a solo set before being followed by the Gary Burton Quintet. From the master cassettes. Recorded from about halfway back in the main center section of the auditorium, using an inexpensive Panasonic mono recorder with ALC and cheap Ampex tapes. The original tapes cannot be located. This digital transfer was made from those tapes early in the 21st century. At that time, EQ was used to remove the extreme bottom frequencies to eliminate rumble and the extreme high frequencies to reduce hiss.","CE_tracklist":null,"transmission:name":null,"transmission:series":null,"transmission:station":null,"transmission:date":null,"transmission:link":null},{"type":"A","concert":"Keith

The CD release was of a higher generation and contained numerous drop outs and other flaws including the omission of tracks 7,8,9,10 and 12 so this should be considered an upgrade. As with the CD, while not high on fidelity, this is quite a nice listen and a sonic improvement with an additional 50% worth of material. Subsequent to its initial circulation, various minor flaws have been repaired in this version. The music is high powered vintage Warne Marsh with an excellent band at an exceptionally rare timeframe in his career and one of the better sessions in the live sessions series.
